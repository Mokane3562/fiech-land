We will be using a USE CASE driven approach to the development of our game.

### Iteration 1 Use Case: Start a New Game
1. User runs the application.
2. User selects "Start New Game".
3. User customizes player.
  1. User enters a name for the player.
  2. User adjusts happiness 'values'.
4. User moves the player around the game board.
